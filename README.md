# LDExplorer

**LDExplorer** is a command-line tool for exploring linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns in SNPs associated with a specific phenotype across a human population. It uses the GWAS Catalog and LDLink APIs to identify associated SNPs, find linked variants, and retrieve traits related to those linked variants.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Match phenotype to its corresponding GWAS EFO ID
- Identify SNPs associated with the phenotype (based on p-value threshold)
- Retrieve linked SNPs using LDLink (based on LD statistics like rÂ²)
- Identify correlated alleles and their associated traits
- Filter results by odds ratio, presence of trait info, or trait keywords
- Export results to JSON (optionally to CSV)
