## GOALS
The goal is to estimate a disease risk based on linkage patterns between genes and their associations with known disease in humans. The proposal is very thorough, I really like the comparison to existing tools at the end!

## DATA
The tool fetches gene IDs from Ensemble associated with a searched phenotype, then searches for linked
genes based on metrics fetched from Ensemble, and returns to the user a set of linked disease phenotypes. 

## CODE
I added some example feedback in the alt_module.py file. It is mostly feedback on formating. It looks like you have a great start though!
