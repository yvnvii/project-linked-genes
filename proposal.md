Linked Genes Explorer

This project is to create a program that retrieves genes that are linked to a given gene input.

This mini-project implements two methods:

# **1. Genes to phenotypes converter (command: --g2p)**
## It asks what species and genes you are looking at. You can only put one species at a time, but you can put many genes of the species in the query. Then it looks for the phenotypes of each gene and creates a file for each gene that contains a list of phenotype of the gene. The file  is automatically named as "{species}_{gene}.txt".

# **2. Phenotypes to genes converter (command: --p2g)**
## It asks what species and phenotypes your are looking at. You can only put one species at a time, but you can put many phenotypes of the species at a time in the query. Then it looks for the genes that can cause each phenotype and creates a file for each phenotype that contain a list of genes that may be implicated. The file is automatically named as "{species}_{phenotype}.txt".

Installation:
conta install [list] -c conda-forge

git clone [https://github.com/yvnvii/mini-project.git]
cd ./mini-project


## 🧬 What task/goal will the project accomplish and why is this useful?

This project aims to create a tool that estimates an individual's genetic risk of inheriting a known disease based on a parent’s diagnosis, by leveraging genetic linkage and phenotypic trait associations — without requiring DNA sequencing.

Instead of expensive genetic tests, the tool uses publicly available genomic data from Ensembl to:

Identify genes linked to a disease-causing gene,

Fetch known traits associated with those linked genes,

And assess how many of those traits are shared between a parent and child.

By comparing phenotypic similarity across genetically linked regions, the program provides a low-cost, accessible method to estimate genetic risk, especially for single-gene (monogenic) disorders like cystic fibrosis, Huntington's disease, and Tay-Sachs.

This is useful for individuals who want to better understand their potential genetic risks when a parent is affected by a disease, but may not have access to expensive commercial genetic testing kits. It can serve as a pre-screening tool or a first step toward genetic counseling.




## 💻 What type of data/input will a user provide to the program?
Users will interact with the program via a command-line interface (CLI) or Jupyter Notebook, and will provide the following inputs:

Phenotype or disease name
The user will enter the name of a disease or phenotype known to affect their parent (e.g., "Cystic Fibrosis", "Huntington’s disease"). This input is used to look up causal genes via the Ensembl API.

Species name
Typically "homo_sapiens", but support is open for any species supported by Ensembl.

Trait survey responses
The program will ask the user simple yes/no questions about observable traits (e.g., “Do you experience increased mucus production?”), which are linked to genes near the disease-causing gene. These answers are used to estimate how similar the user’s traits are to their parent’s, indicating potential inheritance.

(Optional) Parent’s trait data
In advanced versions, the user may also input traits their affected parent exhibits, allowing for more direct phenotype comparison.

There is no need to upload genetic data, such as VCF, FASTA, or raw DNA files — the tool is entirely question-based and API-driven.





## 🌐 Where will the data come from?

This program uses a combination of **user input** and **real-time data retrieved from the Ensembl REST API**, a public online genomics database.

### 🧠 External Data Source: Ensembl REST API  
All gene, variant, and phenotype information is fetched from Ensembl at runtime, using the following endpoints:

| Purpose | Endpoint |
|--------|----------|
| Get causal genes for a phenotype | `/phenotype/term/{species}/{phenotype}` |
| Get phenotypes for a gene | `/phenotype/gene/{species}/{gene}` |
| Get gene location (start/end) | `/lookup/symbol/{species}/{gene}` |
| Find nearby genes (linked) | `/overlap/region/{species}/{region}?feature=gene` |

#### 🔗 API Base URL:  
`https://rest.ensembl.org`

### 💾 Internal Data (Generated by the Program)

The program temporarily stores:
- Lists of genes linked to a phenotype
- Traits associated with those genes
- User responses to trait questions

These can optionally be saved as `.txt`, `.json`, or `.csv` files for future reference or analysis.





## 🧑‍💻 How will a user interact with the program?

Users will interact with the program via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** or a **Jupyter Notebook**, which prompts them step-by-step to explore inherited disease risk.

Here’s what a typical interaction looks like in the CLI:

```bash
🧬 Welcome to the Genetic Risk Estimator

🧠 Enter the phenotype or disease your parent has:
> Cystic Fibrosis

🔬 Fetching genes associated with 'Cystic Fibrosis'...
🧬 Found: CFTR

🔗 Finding genes closely linked to CFTR...
🧬 Nearby genes: WNT2, NUPR1, EEF1A1

🧪 Retrieving phenotypes associated with linked genes...
🧬 WNT2 → Trait: abnormal lung function
🧬 EEF1A1 → Trait: reduced mucus clearance

🎯 Trait Survey — Do you exhibit the following traits?
👉 Do you have abnormal lung function? (yes/no): yes
👉 Do you experience reduced mucus clearance? (yes/no): no

✅ You share 1 out of 2 traits with your parent.
🧠 Estimated inheritance risk: ~50%
```

### ⚙️ User Options (CLI/Notebook Toggles)

- **Disease selection**: Manually type any disease or phenotype term (e.g., “Huntington’s disease”).
- **Species input**: Defaults to `"homo_sapiens"` but accepts others (e.g., `"mus_musculus"`).
- **Flanking region size**: Optional input to customize how far “linked” genes are searched (e.g., ±100kb to ±1Mb).
- **Trait responses**: Simple yes/no answers when prompted.

The interface is designed to be simple, with no need for technical background or genetic data files.




## 📤 What type of output will the program produce?

The program outputs a combination of **text-based results** and optionally **saves data to file** for future reference.

The default output is printed directly to the console (STDOUT), but users also have the option to save results as a `.txt` or `.json` file.

---

### 🧾 Example of Text Output (STDOUT)

```bash

## 🔍 What other tools currently exist to do this task, or something similar?

There are a number of tools and services that assess genetic disease risk, but **none offer a trait-based, low-cost, gene linkage-informed approach** like this project. Most alternatives fall into two main categories:

---

### 🧬 1. **Direct-to-Consumer DNA Testing Services**

These companies use actual DNA samples to analyze disease risk:

- **23andMe**  
  [https://www.23andme.com/](https://www.23andme.com/)  
  Offers health reports for conditions like BRCA breast cancer mutations and cystic fibrosis by genotyping user saliva samples.  
  💰 **Expensive** (~$100–$200)  
  🔐 **Requires genetic data & sample**

- **AncestryDNA + Traits**  
  [https://www.ancestry.com/dna/](https://www.ancestry.com/dna/)  
  Focuses more on ancestry but includes trait reports; disease risk estimation is limited.  
  🧬 DNA-based  
  ⚠️ No support for inherited disease estimation via linkage

---

### 💻 2. **Clinical Genomics Tools**

These tools are used in hospitals or by genetic counselors:

- **ClinVar (NIH/NCBI)**  
  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/)  
  Database of variants with clinical significance, but not an interactive tool. Requires the user to know their own variant IDs or gene info.  
  🔍 **Reference database**, not patient-facing.

- **GeneDx** / **Invitae**  
  [https://www.invitae.com/](https://www.invitae.com/)  
  Clinical-grade genetic testing companies offering disease panels for individuals and families.  
  💰 **Medical-grade** → costly  
  ⚠️ Requires physician or test ordering

## 🌟 How Is This Program Different?

| Feature | Existing Tools | This Project |
|--------|----------------|--------------|
| 🧬 Requires DNA | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| 💰 Cost | High | Free |
| 🧠 Requires Genetics Knowledge | Often | No |
| 🔗 Uses Gene Linkage Info | ❌ Rarely | ✅ Yes |
| 👥 Includes Family/Parent Input | Rare | ✅ Yes |
| 📊 Trait-Based Survey | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |

This program is **unique** in that it estimates disease inheritance risk **without any genetic testing**, using:
- **publicly available gene-phenotype data**,
- **trait comparison**, and
- **genetic linkage analysis**.

It’s like a **“pre-genetic test”** for individuals who can’t afford or access commercial kits — giving people a first glimpse into potential inherited risks using only traits and public data.
